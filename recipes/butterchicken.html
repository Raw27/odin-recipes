    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani, is an Indian dish originating in Delhi. 
        It is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter sauce.

          <h4>Steps</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine chicken pieces, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, cumin, coriander, garam masala, chili powder, and salt. Mix well and marinate for at least 30 minutes, or ideally 2-3 hours in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until they are browned and cooked through, about 7-10 minutes. Remove the chicken and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, add butter and heat until melted. Add chopped onions and saut√© until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add green cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, and cloves to the pan, cooking for another minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed or pureed tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken and the flavors to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked chicken back into the pan, along with any juices that have accumulated. Stir to coat the chicken with the sauce.</li>
            <li>Pour in the heavy cream and stir until the sauce becomes creamy and smooth. Let it simmer for 5-7 minutes, adjusting the seasoning with salt or additional spices as needed.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle in kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) and mix well. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, garnished with fresh cilantro, and enjoy with naan or rice!</li>
          </ol>
